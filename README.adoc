IMPORTANT: The dotfiles in this repository use https://www.chezmoi.io[chezmoi]
for templating. Special filename prefixes such as `dot_`, `empty_` and
`private_` are chezmoi-specific. Check out
https://www.chezmoi.io/docs[chezmoi's documentation] for more details.

=== Notes

* My work computer's hostname is `granger`. All conditional templates based on
  this hostname are only rendered on my work machine.
* Some files are encrypted because they must not be shared outside the context
  of my employer.
* All my machines that are served by this repository run macOS.
